Process Heaps ELI5
==================

Everything in Erlang is a :ref:`Term <def-term>`.

A heap of the process is an array of :ref:`Terms <def-term>`. A stack is
another array of :ref:`Terms <def-term>`. Stack is located inside the heap.
:ref:`Registers <def-registers>` --- are array of :ref:`Terms <def-term>` too!
Things on the heap are mostly arrays of :ref:`Terms <def-term>`, but tagged
with :ref:`header tag <def-header>` (see :doc:`indepth-memory-layout`).

Heap Carriers
-------------

Allocation in Erlang happens inside so called “carriers”. They look like
“zone memory”, used by games — big chunks of system heap pre-allocated
beforehand. Inside carriers the real allocation is happening. For simplicity
you can imagine simple malloc/realloc, that’s how its done.

This complication is done to fight memory fragmentation and is not important
for the understanding.
You can see ``erts/emulator/beam/erl_*alloc.c`` (many those files, one per
strategy of allocation). Emulator has command line flags, which control
allocation strategies (see http://erlang.org/doc/man/erts_alloc.html flags
section).

Allocating Inside Heap
----------------------

When a process needs some memory, its ``heap_top`` is incremented and memory
under it is ready to use. Some activities may want to allocate on other
process' heaps, for example sending a message will perform a copy to the
receiving process.

No bookkeeping is happening inside a process heap.
There is no tracking which word belongs where, but it is possible to know
what is stored in each memory cell by looking at the tag bits.

Garbage Collection
------------------

Garbage collector traces known live values from registers and stack and saves
them, then drops everything else.

When a heap comes to its capacity threshold (something like 75%), the process
triggers garbage collection. A new bigger heap may be allocated.
Scanning generational garbage collection algorithm runs on the heap.
The algorithm takes the “:ref:`roots <def-roots>`” and moves them to the
new heap.
Then it scans the remaining parts of source heap
and extracts more values, referred by the roots. After the scanning, source
heap contains only dead values and algorithm drops it.

"Scanning" means, that garbage collector follows the data
:ref:`roots <def-roots>` from the start to the end, parsing everything it meets.
"Generational" means, that algorithm splits data into young and old generation,
assuming that data often dies young, and old data is less likely to be freed.
Also the algorithm remembers the old position (``mature``), where the previous
scanning has finished.
Any data below it is guaranteed to have not updated since the last scan.
This trick reduces amount of scanning and speeds up the algorithm.

In reality the picture is a bit more complicated. There can be one or two
heaps with different placement logic applied to them.

Having garbage collector run per process heap allows Erlang to keep
collection latency low. Also it doesn’t pause or affect other processes on
other schedulers. This is not a simple topic, but theory is all here:
