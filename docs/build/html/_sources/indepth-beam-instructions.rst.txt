BEAM Instruction Codes
======================

BEAM file stores code in ``Code`` section, using 1 byte for opcode, and encoding
arguments one after one using :ref:`compact term encoding <beam-term-format>`.
Opcode table defines arity, or how many arguments each opcode can take.

The table is not complete, for details on remaining opcodes please refer to
`LING VM opcode table <http://erlangonxen.org/more/beam>`_ or to the source
``beam_emu.c``. Also see the opcode rules table ``ops.tab``, which defines
special opcodes and rules to to create superinstructions.
Superinstructions bundle several often used instructions into one and try to
optimize for specific argument types.

As of R19 there are 158 base opcodes and several hundreds of superinstructions.

Opcode Table
------------

Search for "#N" to find opcode N.

**Slots** are special values marking stack cell or a register. They can be
used to point at the data source or move destination. There are several
values of secondary tag which denote them.

.. |op-no-update-cp| replace:: Does not update the CP register with a return
    address, making return bypass current code location.

.. |op-save-cp| replace:: Return address is saved in CP.

.. |op-mfarity-def| replace:: mfarity (a tuple ``{Mod, Fun, Arity}``)
    which can point to an exported function or a BIF

.. |op-mfarity-def-short| replace:: mfarity (a tuple ``{Mod, Fun, Arity}``)

#2 func_info
````````````

``Func_info`` is located at the beginning of every function, but execution
always begins at the next label.
If all function clauses have failed guard checks, VM will jump to this
instruction.
It raises ``function_clause`` error with appropriate line number.

#4 call
```````

Spec: ``call Arity Label``

Saves current IP to CP (return address) and jumps to the ``Label``,
which usually is a function entry point.

#5 call_last
````````````

Spec: ``call_last Arity Label Deallocate``

Deallocates ``Deallocate`` words on stack and does a tail recursive call (jump)
to the function at ``Label``.
|op-no-update-cp|

#6 call_only
````````````

Spec: ``call_only Arity Label``

Performs tail recursive call of a function at ``Label``.
|op-no-update-cp|

#7 call_ext
```````````

Spec: ``call_ext Arity Destination::mfarity()``

Performs call to an external ``Destination`` |op-mfarity-def|.
|op-save-cp|

#8 call_ext_last
````````````````

Spec: ``call_ext_last Arity Destination::mfarity() Deallocate``

Deallocates ``Deallocate`` words from stack and performs a tail recursive
call to an external ``Destination`` |op-mfarity-def|.
|op-no-update-cp|

#9 bif0
```````

Spec: ``bif0 ImportIndex Dst::mfarity()`` (note no fail label)

Looks up BIF with zero arguments by ``Dst`` |op-mfarity-def-short| and calls it.
Cannot silently fail by jumping to a label and will always throw an exception.

#10 bif1 #11 bif2 #152 bif3
```````````````````````````

Spec: ``bif1 Fail::label() ImportIndex Arg1 Dst::mfarity()``

Spec: ``bif2 Fail::label() ImportIndex Arg1 Arg2 Dst::mfarity()``

Spec: ``bif3 Fail::label() ImportIndex Arg1 Arg2 Arg3 Dst::mfarity()``

Looks up BIF with 1, 2 or 3 arguments by ``Dst`` |op-mfarity-def-short|
and calls it.
If ``Fail`` label is valid (not 0?), VM will jump to the label on error,
otherwise will throw an exception.

#12 allocate #14 allocate_zero
``````````````````````````````

Spec: ``allocate StackNeed Live``

Spec: ``allocate_zero StackNeed Live``

Allocates ``StackNeed`` words on the stack (a stack frame).
``Live`` defines how many X registers are currently in use (for GC call).
Current CP value is saved on top of the stack.
``Allocate_zero`` writes NIL to all new stack cells, while ``allocate`` may
or may not do this.

#13 allocate_heap #15 allocate_heap_zero
````````````````````````````````````````

Spec: ``allocate_heap StackNeed HeapNeed Live``

Spec: ``allocate_heap_zero StackNeed HeapNeed Live``

Allocates ``StackNeed`` words on the stack and ensures that there are
``HeapNeed`` available words on the heap.
``Live`` defines how many X registers are currently in use (for GC call).
Current CP value is saved on top of the stack.
``Allocate_heap_zero`` writes NIL to all new stack (possibly heap too?) cells,
while ``allocate_heap`` may or may not do this.

#16 test_heap
`````````````

Spec: ``test_heap Need Live``

Ensures there are at least ``Need`` words on the heap. If needed, GC is
performed using ``Live`` values from registers array.

#17 init
````````

Spec: ``init Y``

Clears ``Y+1``-th stack word by writing ``NIL``. Offset by one is there because
CP is also stored on stack but it is not considered an ``Y`` cell.

#18 deallocate
``````````````

Spec: ``deallocate N``

Restores CP from stack and deallocates ``N+1`` words from stack (one extra for
the CP).

#19 return
``````````

Jumps to current value of CP register. Sets CP to 0.

#20 send
````````

Sends value ``X[1]`` to the process specified by ``X[0]``. ``X[1]`` becomes
the result of the operation (is moved to ``X[0]``).

#21 remove_message
``````````````````

Unlinks current message from the message queue. Message is moved to ``X[0]``.
*Current* means that there is a movable pointer to a message in the linked list.

#23 loop_rec
````````````

Spec: ``loop_rec Label Source``

Picks up next message in the queue and places it into ``X[0]``. If there is no
message, jumps to ``Label`` which points to a ``wait`` or ``wait_timeout``
instruction.

#24 loop_rec_end
````````````````

Spec: ``loop_rec_end Label``

Advances message pointer to the next message, then jump to ``Label`` which
points to a ``loop_rec`` instruction.

#25 wait
````````

Spec: ``wait Label``

Jumps to the ``Label`` and immediately suspends the process (wait for event).

Comparisons
```````````

Spec: ``<opcode> Label Arg1 Arg2``

Performs a comparison and jumps to ``Label`` if false.

*   #39 ``is_lt`` - is less
*   #40 ``is_ge`` - is greater or equal

*   #50 ``is_reference``
*   #51 ``is_port``
*   #52 ``is_nil``
*   #53 ``is_binary``
*   #54 ``is_constant`` - possibly checks if term belongs to literal area of a module?

*   #57 ``is_tuple``
*   #77 ``is_function``
*   #114 ``is_boolean``

#59 select_val
``````````````

Spec: ``select_val Arg FailLabel Destinations``

Scans ``Destinations`` even elements (0, 2, 4...) and compares with ``Arg``.
If match is found, jumps to the label in the next odd element (1, 3, 5...)
otherwise jumpts to ``FailLabel``.
By "match" naive compare is meant.

#60 select_tuple_arity
``````````````````````

Spec: ``select_tuple_arity Tuple FailLabel Destinations``

Check the arity of the ``Tuple`` and jump to the corresponding ``Destination``
label, if no arity matches, jump to ``FailLabel``.

#61 jump
````````

Spec: ``jump Address``

#62 catch
`````````

Spec: ``catch Y Label``

Saves a resumption address &CatchEnd in the local frame at position
``Y``. Increments the process catch counter. The instruction is followed by a
``catch_end`` instruction. By followed we mean that the ``catch_end``
instruction is put after corresponding Erlang expression that is protected
from errors by the catch.

#63 catch_end
`````````````

Spec: ``catch_end Y``

Clears a resumption address stored in the local frame at position ``Y``.
Decrements the process catch counter.
This instruction is preceded by a matching ``catch`` instruction.

#64 move
````````

Spec: ``move Src Dst``

Moves value from the ``Src`` to the ``Dst``.

``Src`` can be a value or a slot.
``Dst`` must be a slot.

#65 get_list
````````````

Spec: ``get_list Source Head Tail``

Gets the head and tail of a list (splits its cons cell) from ``Source``
and puts values into the registers ``Head`` and ``Tail``.

#66 get_tuple_element
`````````````````````

Spec ``get_tuple_element Source Element Destination::slot()``

Gets ``Element``-th item from the tuple denoted by ``Source`` and puts
it into the ``Destination`` slot.

#69 put_list
````````````

Spec: ``put_list H T Dst::slot()``

Creates a cons cell with ``[H|T]`` and places the value into ``Dst``.

#70 put_tuple #71 put
`````````````````````

Spec ``put_tuple Arity Dst``

This opcode is followed by ``Arity`` repeated ``put Value`` opcodes.
Creates an empty tuple of ``Arity`` and places pointer to it into ``Dst``.
Then moves instruction pointer forward, while next opcode is ``put``,
reads argument for every ``put`` and places it into the next tuple element.
Stops after ``Arity`` steps.

#72 badmatch
````````````
Produces an error.

#73 if_clause
`````````````

Produces an error.

#74 case_clause
```````````````

Produces an error.

#75 call_fun
````````````

Spec: ``call_fun Arity``

Calls a fun or export.
Arguments are in ``X[0..Arity-1]``.
Function object is in ``X[Arity]``.
|op-save-cp|

Raises ``badarity`` if arity does not match the function object.
Raises ``badfun`` if object is not callable (not a fun or export).

#76 make_fun
````````````

Seems to be deprecated, so compiler always generates ``make_fun2``.

#78 call_ext_only
`````````````````

Spec: ``call_ext_only Arity Destination::mfarity()``

Performs a tail recursive call to a ``Destination`` |op-mfarity-def|.
|op-no-update-cp|

#89 bs_put_integer/5
````````````````````

Spec: ``bs_put_integer Fail=j Sz=sq Unit=u Flags=u Src=s``

An integer from ``src`` and having bitsize ``sz`` is appended to the current
writable binary (stored in the internal state) at the current bit offset
(stored in the state too).

#103 make_fun2
``````````````

Spec: ``make_fun2 Lambda``

Produces a callable fun object. ``Lambda`` should be resolved at load time
to a function entry. Creates a callable box object on the heap which points
to this fun object and also has space to store frozen values (Free variables).

#104 try/2
``````````

Spec ``try Yregister Label``

Begins a guarded code section by writing a special crafted catch value into the
given Y register. The catch value points to the label in case of exception, where
a ``try_case`` instruction is located.

#105 try_end/1
``````````````

Spec: ``try_end Yregister``

Ends the guarded section by clearing the catch value on stack with a NIL.

#106 try_case/1
```````````````

Begins investigation of an exception, also clears the catch value on stack. From
here if you need the exception to propagate, you have to raise it again.

#107 try_case_end/1
```````````````````

#108 raise/2
````````````

Spec: ``raise Stacktrace ExcValue``

A legacy instruction which takes error type from the provided stacktrace
object and creates an exception with the exception value (second argument).

#109 bs_init2/6
```````````````

Creates a new writable binary of requested size with some extra words, runs GC
if needed, then the binary is stored in the internal state. Following ``bs_put*``
instructions will add to it. The write bit offset in the internal state is
also reset to 0.

#112 apply #113 apply_last
``````````````````````````

Spec ``apply Arity``

Spec ``apply_last Arity Dealloc``

Calls function at ``X[Arity+1]`` in module ``X[Arity]``
with arguments ``X[0..Arity-1]``. Module is an atom or a tuple. Function is an
atom.

``Apply`` saves current instruction pointer into CP and performs a
call to the destination.

``Apply_last`` cuts the stack by ``Dealloc`` words preserving the CP on top
of the stack, and then jumps to the destination.

#136 trim
`````````

Spec: ``trim N _Remaining``

Drops ``N`` words on stack after saved CP, moving it ``N`` words up.

Binary Matching and Operations
------------------------------

#119 bs_get_binary2/7
`````````````````````

Spec: ``bs_get_binary2 Fail MatchState Live Size Unit Dst``

For current binary match position (started by ``bs_start_match*``) extract
a sub-binary (a slice) and return it. ``Live`` is used for an occasional garbage
collection act if the memory is tight. ``Size:Unit`` determines how many bits
go into the result.


#166 bs_start_match3
````````````````````

Spec ``bs_start_match3 Fail Context Live Dst``

This opcode was introduced in OTP 22 and replaces ``bs_start_match2``.

Depending on whether the value in the ``Context`` is binary, or an existing match
state, creates a new match state if needed. The position from the match state is used
for binary matching step by step by the following ``bs_*`` opcodes.

#121 bs_test_tail2
``````````````````

Spec: ``bs_test_tail2 Fail, MatchState, N``

Ensures that the match state has ``N`` bits remaining for processing. If this is
not true, the VM will jump to the ``Fail`` label.
