Data Types Memory Layout
========================

This describes data format on heap, as seen in C code or from debugger.
You will never be able to see this format from Erlang code.

Immediate values
----------------

    :align: center

Immediate types always occupy 1 :ref:`Word <def-word>`. To know if you found
an immediate, its least-significant 2 bits will have value
``TAG_PRIMARY_IMMED1=3``.

To know which exactly immediate you've got, see the two following bits
(bit 2 and 3):
``_TAG_IMMED1_PID=0``,
``_TAG_IMMED1_PORT=1``,
``_TAG_IMMED1_SMALL=3``.
This leaves remaining :ref:`Word-size <def-word>` minus 4 bits for the
actual value.

If the bits 2 and 3 contained ``_TAG_IMMED1_IMMED2=2`` then two more bits
(bit 4 and 5) are taken and interpreted.
They can be
``_TAG_IMMED2_ATOM=0``,
``_TAG_IMMED2_CATCH=1``
``_TAG_IMMED2_NIL=3``,
which leaves remaining :ref:`Word-size <def-word>` minus 6 bits for the
actual value.

This also explains why max small integer range is ``32-4=28``:
``2^27-1`` + one bit sign, because small is an immediate-1 value.
And why max number of atoms can be ``32-6=26`` (2^26=32 million), because
atom is an immediate-2 value.
For compatibility reasons this limit also applies to 64-bit systems.

Lists (Cons)
------------

.. image:: _static/img/memory-layout-list.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center

A list term is boxed value (i.e. contains a pointer to heap). 2 least-significant
bits of list value have ``TAG_PRIMARY_LIST=1``, remaining bits are the pointer.

A value on heap
contains 2 :ref:`Words <def-word>` -- namely CAR (or list head) and
CDR (list tail) (see ``CAR`` and ``CDR`` macros in ``emulator/beam/erl_term.h``).
This pair of words is called "Cons Cell" (terminology from
Lisp and functional programming). Cons cell has no header word stored in memory.

Each cons cell contains pointer to next cell in CDR (tail).
As this is also visible from Erlang, last cons cell of a list contains ``NIL``
(a special value for empty list ``[]``) or a non-list :ref:`Term <def-term>`
value (this makes *improper* list).

This structure may look inefficient, but on the other hand it allows
connecting any tail of any list to multiple cons cells to reuse existing data.

Boxed
-----

.. image:: _static/img/memory-layout-box.png
    :width: 350
    :align: center

Boxed value is a pointer with 2 least-significant bits tagged with
``TAG_PRIMARY_BOXED=2``. Remaining bits are the pointer.

A boxed pointer must always point to a :ref:`Header <def-header>`
(see explanation of headers below). Boxed values can be found everywhere:
in registers, on stack, on heaps.

Box always points at a Header (below).
During the garbage collection a Box can point to another Box or to
``THE_NON_VALUE`` to mark a moved object, but never after.

Headers
-------

Header tag is placed on any boxed value on heap, also on temporary blocks used
by internal emulator logic, they will be automatically garbage collected later.

Header values can never be found in register or on stack. This is heap-only data structure.

Tuple (ARITYVAL=0)
``````````````````

.. image:: _static/img/memory-layout-tuple.png
    :width: 350
    :align: center

A tuple has header word tagged with ``TAG_PRIMARY_HEADER`` with ``ARITYVAL_SUBTAG``.
Remaining bits in header word represent tuple arity
(see ``arityval`` and ``make_arityval`` macros).

Following are tuple elements. This explains, why tuple is very easy to access at
arbitrary index, and very hard to grow. Modification of tuple elements in place
is used as optimization by Erlang compiler if it can prove, that intermediate
tuple value will be dropped.

Bignum (NEG=2/POS_BIG=3)
````````````````````````

.. image:: _static/img/memory-layout-bignum.png
    :width: 350
    :align: center

Bignums have header word tagged with ``TAG_PRIMARY_HEADER`` followed by either
``POS_BIG_SUBTAG`` or ``NEG_BIG_SUBTAG``. Remaining bits in header word are arity,
i.e. how many extra :ref:`Words <def-word>` are used by bignum bits.

Following are bits of the bignum, a :ref:`Word <def-word>` at a time.
Most significant word goes first.

Reference (REF=4)
`````````````````

.. image:: _static/img/memory-layout-ref.png
    :width: 350
    :align: center

See struct ``RefThing`` in ``emulator/beam/erl_term.h``.
Contains header word tagged with ``TAG_PRIMARY_HEADER`` with ``REF_SUBTAG`` which
also matches the first field of ``RefThing``.

Following are other ``RefThing`` fields (3 32-bit words or 2 64-bit words) which
have the ref value stored in them. Internal (local) ref layout is explained in
``emulator/beam/erl_term.h`` search for text "Ref layout (internal references)" and
"Ref layout on a 64-bit" (2 comments).

Fun/Closure (FUN=5)
```````````````````

See struct ``ErlFunThing`` in ``erl_fun.h``.
Contains header word tagged with ``TAG_PRIMARY_HEADER`` with ``FUN_SUBTAG`` which
also matches the first field of ``ErlFunThing``.

This is a closure (a function pointer with frozen variable values). It contains
pointer to function entry, arity, amount
of frozen variables, pid of creator process and array of frozen variables.

Float (FLOAT=6)
```````````````

Contains header word tagged with ``TAG_PRIMARY_HEADER`` with ``FLOAT_SUBTAG``.
Followed by 64 bit of C ``double`` IEEE-754 format.

Export (EXPORT=7)
`````````````````

.. image:: _static/img/memory-layout-export.png
    :width: 250
    :align: right

Refers to a ``{Mod, Fun, Arity}``. Contains a pointer to the *export table*.
Always has arity 1 (because only one pointer).

A record in export table contains:

*   Pointers to all (old and current) versions of the code for the function
*   2 words with ``func_info`` opcode for the function.
    Note, that this is executable BEAM code.
*   3 words: Module (atom), Function (atom), Arity (as untagged integer)
*   1 word which is 0 or may contain a apply, call or breakpoint opcode.
    Note, that this is executable BEAM code.
*   1 word argument for the previous opcode. May be a pointer to BEAM code,
    a pointer to a C BIF function or 0.

.. seealso:: ``Export`` struct in ``emulator/beam/export.h``

Reference-counted Binary (REFC_BINARY=8)
````````````````````````````````````````

A pointer to binary on the binary heap. When this is destroyed, the reference
count is reduced (can only happen during GC).
Reference to refc binary is called procbin.
A refc binary whose refc reaches 0 is deleted.

Heap Binary (HEAP_BINARY=9)
```````````````````````````

A smaller binary (under 64 bytes) which is directly placed on the process heap.

Sub-binary (SUB_BINARY=10)
``````````````````````````

A temporary pointer to a part of another binary (either heap or refcounted,
but never into another sub-binary).
Can be produced by ``split_binary`` function.

Match context
`````````````

Similar to sub-binary but is optimized for binary matching.

Ext Pid 12
``````````

Pid containing node name. Refers to a process on another node.

Ext Port 13
```````````

Port containing node name. Refers to a port on another node.

Ext Ref (EXTERNAL_REF=14)
`````````````````````````

External ref format is explained in ``erl_term.h`` search for "External thing layout".
