# BEAM File Format

BEAM file format is binary chunked file format, which contains multiple named
sections and has a header.

* Read 4 bytes of a .beam file: `'FOR1'`
  (marks [IFF container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_File_Format)).
* Read U32/big length (so many more bytes must be available in the file)
* Read 4 bytes `'BEAM'` marking a BEAM file section of an IFF file.

## Sections

Repeat until end of file:

* Read 4 bytes chunk name (for example can be: Atom, Code, CatT, FunT, ExpT,
  LitT, StrT, ImpT, Line, Abst and possibly other chunks).
  Do a sanity check: Must contain ASCII letters.
* Read U32/big chunk length. This is the data size.
* Perform chunk-dependent reading (see subsections below)
* To find next chunk, pad the length to the multiple of ALIGN=4

```C
file_pos += ALIGN * ((chunk_length + ALIGN - 1) / ALIGN);
```

### "Atom" and "AtU8" - Atoms Table

Both tables have same format and same limitations (256 bytes max length)
except that bytes in strings are treated either as latin1 or utf8.

* Read U32/big atoms count.
* For each atom: read byte length, followed by characters

Atoms[0] is a module name from `-module(M).` attribute.

### "Code" - Compiled Bytecode

* Read U32/big code version (must match emulator's own version)
* Read U32/big max opcode, U32/big label count, U32/big fun count
* Read the code as a block. Format is discussed at [](#beam-code-section-format).

### "Abst" - Abstract Syntax Tree

Optional section which contains `term_to_binary` encoded AST tree.

A quick way to get `Abst` section (if it exists):

```C
get_abst(Filename) ->
    Chunks = beam_lib:all_chunks(Filename),
    Abst = proplists:get_value("Abst", element(3, Chunks)),
    binary_to_term(Abst).
```

### "CatT" - Catch Table

Contains catch labels nicely lined up and marking try/catch blocks.
This section description is INCOMPLETE and UNTESTED.

* Read U32/big count
* Read array of `count` U32/big offsets or labels (not sure).

### "FunT" - Function/Lambda Table

Contains pointers to functions in the module.

* Read U32/big count

Until the `count` do:

* Read U32/big fun_atom_index (name by index from atom table),
  U32/big `arity`,
  U32/big `offset` (code position),
  U32/big `index`,
  U32/big `nfree` (frozen values for closures),
  U32/big `ouniq`. Sanity check: fun_Atom_index must be in atom table range.

### "ExpT" - Exports Table

Encodes exported functions and arity in the `-export([]).` attribute.

* Read U32/big count

Until the `count` do:

* Read U32/big export name atom index. Sanity check: atom table range.
* Read U32/big arity, U32/big label (offset in BEAM code section, should
  be translated into the loaded code offset).

### "LitT" - Literals Table

Contains all the constants in file which are larger than 1 machine Word.
It is compressed using zip Deflate.

* Read U32/big uncompressed size (prepare output buffer of this size). Run
  zip inflate (decompression) on the data.

Inside the uncompressed data:

* Read U32/big value count

Until the `value count` do:

* Skip U32/big
* Read byte ext term format marker (must be 131)
* Read tag byte, ... (follow the documentation)

Values are encoded using the external term format.
A better reference is in the
[standard documentation](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html)

### "ImpT" - Imports Table

Encodes functions from other modules invoked by the current module.

* Read U32/big count

Until the `count` do:

* Read U32/big module atom index, U32/big function atom index, U32/big arity

### "LocT" - Local Functions

Essentially same as the export table format `ExpT` for local functions.

* Read U32/big count

Until the `count` do:

* Read U32/big func atom index, U32/big arity, U32/big location (label)

### "Line" - Line Numbers Table

Encodes line numbers mapping to give better error reporting and code navigation
for the program user.

* Read U32/big `version` (must match emulator's own version 0).
* Skip U32/big `flags`
* Read U32/big `line_instr_count`, U32/big `num_line_refs`, U32/big `num_filenames`
* Store invalid location const as `Word[] linerefs` first element which points
  at file #0, line 0.
* Set `fname_index = 0`, this is index in file name table, empty now

Until the `num_line_refs` do:

* Parse term at read position (see [](#beam-compact-term-encoding))
* If the term is a small integer, push a pair of (`fname_index`, value) to
  the linerefs array.
* If the term is an atom, use its numeric value as new `fname_index`. Sanity
  check: value must be under `num_filenames`.

Until the `num_filenames` do (fill the file names table):

* Read U16/big name size
* Read string of bytes
* Convert string to an atom and push into file names table

### "StrT" - Strings Table

This is a huge binary with all concatenated strings from the Erlang parsed AST
(syntax tree). Everything `{string, X}` goes here. There are no size markers
or separators between strings, so opcodes that need these values (e.g. bs_put_string)
must provide an index and a string length to extract what they need out of this
chunk.

Consider `compiler` application in standard library, files:
`beam_asm`, `beam_dict` (record `#asm{}` field `strings`), and
`beam_disasm`.

### "Attr" - Attributes

Contains two parts: a proplist of module attributes, encoded as External Term
Format, and a compiler info (options and version) encoded similarly.

## BEAM Compact Term Encoding

BEAM file uses a special encoding to store simple terms in BEAM file in a space-efficient way. It is different from
memory term layout, used by BEAM VM.

The idea is to stick as many type and value data into the 1st byte as possible::

    7 6 5 4 3 | 2 1 0
    ----------+------
              | 0 0 0 — Literal
              | 0 0 1 — Integer
              | 0 1 0 — Atom
              | 0 1 1 — X Register
              | 1 0 0 — Y Register
              | 1 0 1 — Label
              | 1 1 0 — Character
    0 0 0 1 0 | 1 1 1 — Extended — Float
    0 0 1 0 0 | 1 1 1 — Extended — List
    0 0 1 1 0 | 1 1 1 — Extended — Floating point register
    0 1 0 0 0 | 1 1 1 — Extended — Allocation list
    0 1 0 1 0 | 1 1 1 — Extended — Literal

> Note: From OTP 20 the Floats are encoded as literals, and every other extended code
> is shifted, i.e. List becomes 1 (0b10111), Float register becomes 2 (0b100111),
> alloc list becomes 3 (0b110111) and literal becomes 4 (0b1000111).

It uses first 3 bits of a first byte as a tag to specify the type of the
following value.
If the bits were all 1 (special value 7), then few more bits are used.

For values under 16 the value is placed entirely into bits 4-5-6-7 having bit
3 set to 0::

    7 6 5 4 | 3 | 2 1 0
    --------+---+------
    Value>> | 0 | Tag>>

For values under 16#800 (2048) bit 3 is set to 1, marks that 1 continuation
byte will be used and 3 most significant bits of the value will extend into
this byte's bits 5-6-7::

    7 6 5 | 4 3 | 2 1 0
    ------+-----+------
    Value | 0 1 | Tag>>

Larger and negative values are first converted to bytes.
Then, if the value takes 2..8 bytes, bits 3-4 will be set to 1, and bits
5-6-7 will contain the `(Bytes-2)` size for the value, which follows::

    7  6  5 | 4 3 | 2 1 0
    --------+-----+------
    Bytes-2 | 1 1 | Tag>>

If the following value is greater than 8 bytes, then all bits 3-4-5-6-7
will be set to 1, followed by a nested encoded unsigned `?tag_u` value
of `(Bytes-9):8`, and then the data::

    7 6 5 4 3 | 2 1 0
    ----------+------ Followed by nested encoded int (Size-9)
    1 1 1 1 1 | Tag>>

> See also:
> Refer to `beam_asm:encode/2` in the `compiler` application for
> details about how this is encoded. Tag values are presented in this
> section, but also can be found in `compiler/src/beam_opcodes.hrl`.

### Base and Extended Tag

Let's parse the value of `tag`:

* Read a byte and extract its least 3 bits. This is the base tag.
  It can be Literal=0, Integer=1, Atom=2, XRegister=3, YRegister=4, Label=5,
  Character=6, Extended=7.
* If the base tag was Extended=7, then bits 4-5-6-7 PLUS 7 will become
  the extended tag. It can have values
  Float=8, List=9, FloatReg=10, AllocList=11, Literal=12.

routine used to read signed words later:

A badly written and incomplete
[GitHub example of parsing a small integer](https://github.com/kvakvs/gluonvm1/blob/master/emulator/src/beam_loader.cpp#L535-L555):
(used to read SmallInt values later).

### Reading the Value

This is the logic, as was decoded from source code of BEAM VM and Ling VM.
It looks at the bits in slightly different order.

* Look into the first byte read, bit 3:

    * Bit 3 is 1, so look into bit 4:

        *     Bit is 1: Use remaining 3 bits of the byte as byte length
                (if under 7 - read `N+2` bytes into signed words,
                if the value is 7 - then length is larger than that and we
                have to read length first -- it follows as `?tag_u=0`
                (Literal) nested unsigned value)
        *     Bit 4 is 0: use remaining 3 bits + 8 more bits of the following byte

    * Bit #3 = 0: Use remaining 4 bits

Now how to parse an encoded term:

* Read a SmallInt, case `tag` of:

    * Tag=Integer: use the value (signed?)
    * Tag=Literal: use smallint value as index in `LitT` table.
    * Tag=Atom: use smallint value MINUS 1 as index in the atom table.
      0 smallint means `NIL []`.
    * Tag=Label: use as label index, or 0 means invalid value.
    * Tag=XRegister, Tag=YRegister: use as register index.
    * Tag=Character (a Unicode symbol): use val as unsigned.
    * Tag=Extended List: contains pairs of terms.
      Read smallint `Size`. Create tuple of `Size`, which will contain
      `Size/2` values.
      For `Size/2` do:
      read and parse a term (`case of` value),
      read a small int (label index), place them into the tuple.

## BEAM Code Section Format

Code section in BEAM file contains list of instructions and arguments. To read an encoded term
see [](#beam-compact-term-encoding).

* Read a byte, this is opcode (OTP 19 had 158 base opcodes and more are added with newer versions). Opcode is converted
  into a label address (for threaded interpreter) or a pointer to handler function.
* Query opcode table and get arity for this opcode.
* Until `arity` repeat: parse term and put it into the output one term or word at a time. VM loop will read the opcode
  later and expect that `arity` count of args will follow it.
* If any of the parsed terms was a label value, remember its output position to later revisit it and overwrite with
  actual label address in memory (it is not known until code parsing is done).
